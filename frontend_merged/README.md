## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Make sure your FastAPI backend is running:**
   ```bash
   cd ../
   python start_api.py --reload
   ```

4. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## 🏢 Business Logic Implementation

### Pay Period Management
- **Central Concept**: Every operation is tied to a pay period
- **Automated Scheduling**: Generate bi-weekly, weekly, monthly periods
- **Current Period Detection**: Automatically highlights active periods
- **Status Tracking**: Active, Completed, Future period states

### Employee Management
- **Real Statuses**: Active, Inactive, Helper/Apprentice, Excluded from Payroll
- **Pay Types**: Efficiency Pay (max logic) vs Hourly + Commission
- **Commission Overrides**: Custom rates per employee per business unit
- **Smart Detection**: Auto-add employees from timesheet uploads

### Commission Calculation
- **Lead Generation**: Commission for bringing in customers
- **Sales**: Commission for closing deals
- **Work Done**: Commission split among performing technicians
- **Efficiency Pay**: Employees get max(hourly_pay, total_commission)
- **Multi-tech Support**: Helpers don't get commission, work split properly

### Data Management
- **Revenue Column Detection**: Dynamically finds "Jobs Total Revenue"
- **File Upload Validation**: CSV/Excel with progress tracking
- **Smart Auto-Detection**: Employees and business units from data
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed validation feedback

});

// Commission calculation
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: commissionService.calculateCommissions,
  onSuccess: (data) => setCommissionResults(data),
});

await uploadService.uploadTimesheet(file, (progress) => {
  setUploadProgress(progress);
});
```
