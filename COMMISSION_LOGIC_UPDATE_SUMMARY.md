# üìã Commission Logic Update Summary
*Date: August 2, 2025*

## ‚úÖ **Commission Logic Confirmation**

All commissions in the Commission Calculator Pro are **revenue-based**. Every commission type is calculated as a percentage of the job revenue amount.

### **Commission Types**

1. **Lead Generated By** 
   - Person who generated the lead for the job
   - Earns: `revenue √ó lead_gen_rate%`

2. **Sold By**
   - Person who closed the sale
   - Earns: `revenue √ó sold_by_rate%`

3. **Work Done**
   - Technicians who performed the work
   - Earns: `revenue √ó work_done_rate%` (split equally if multiple technicians)

### **Example Calculation**
For a $100,000 revenue job with rates: Lead Gen 5%, Sales 7.5%, Work Done 3%
- Lead Generator: $100,000 √ó 5% = $5,000
- Salesperson: $100,000 √ó 7.5% = $7,500
- 3 Technicians: $100,000 √ó 3% = $3,000 total ($1,000 each)
